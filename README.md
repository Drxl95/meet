## Description 
This is a Progressive web application that was built with React using a test-driven and behavior driven development approach .  It consists of a Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events, and a serverless function hosted by AWS.  
Users can select a city from a list of suggestions or see all cities, and they can also choose the number of events to see.  It also includes a scatter plot and pie chart.

## Quick Start üöÄ

# FEATURE 1: Filter Events By City

 - Given: the main page is open
 - When: user starts typing in the city textbox
 - Then: the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they‚Äôve typed

 - Given: the user was typing ‚ÄúBerlin‚Äù in the city textbox
 - And the list of suggested cities is showing
 - When: the user selects a city (e.g., ‚ÄúBerlin, Germany‚Äù) from the list
 - Then: their city should be changed to that city (i.e., ‚ÄúBerlin, Germany‚Äù)
 - And the list of suggestions should disappear.
 - And the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city.
